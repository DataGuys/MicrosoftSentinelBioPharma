## Regulatory Requirements

Security monitoring of GxP-validated systems must comply with multiple regulations:

| Regulation | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| 21 CFR Part 11 | Electronic records integrity and audit trails |
| EU Annex 11 | Computerized system validation and data security |
| ICH Q9 | Quality risk management for monitoring controls |
| ISO 27001 | Information security management framework |
| GAMP 5 | Risk-based approach to computerized systems |

## System Qualification Process

Implementing Azure Sentinel for GxP environments requires formal qualification:

### Installation Qualification (IQ)

1. **Infrastructure Verification**:
   - Azure Sentinel workspaces deployment
   - Network connectivity to GxP systems
   - Data collection rules configuration
   - Storage accounts for immutable audit trails

2. **System Components Inventory**:
   - Document all components in the monitoring infrastructure
   - Define system boundaries and interfaces
   - Identify regulated vs. non-regulated components

### Operational Qualification (OQ)

1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Data collection from all GxP systems
   - Alerts and analytics rules functionality
   - Audit trail capture and integrity
   - User access controls and permissions

2. **Security Controls Testing**:
   - Authentication mechanisms
   - Encryption of data in transit and at rest
   - Segregation of duties enforcement
   - Log immutability verification

### Performance Qualification (PQ)

1. **Production Validation**:
   - End-to-end data flow validation
   - Alert response procedures testing
   - Compliance reporting verification
   - Retention policy enforcement

2. **Business Process Integration**:
   - Integration with change control system
   - Deviation management processes
   - Audit preparation procedures
   - Periodic review protocols

## Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to implement validated monitoring:

### 1. Define User Requirements

Document specific requirements aligned with GxP regulations:

```
# User Requirements Specification Example

UR-01: The system shall collect all audit trail data from GxP-validated manufacturing systems
UR-02: The system shall retain electronic records for a minimum of 7 years
UR-03: The system shall detect unauthorized changes to validated systems
UR-04: The system shall provide reports for regulatory inspections
UR-05: The system shall maintain the integrity of all collected data
```

### 2. Risk Assessment

Conduct a formal risk assessment:

1. Identify potential risks to data integrity and security
2. Evaluate impact and likelihood of each risk
3. Define mitigation controls for high-risk areas
4. Document residual risks and acceptance criteria

### 3. Technical Implementation

Deploy Azure Sentinel with GxP-specific configurations:

```bash
# Deploy manufacturing-specific workspace with 21 CFR Part 11 compliance
./deploy-biopharma.sh -g "rg-sentinel-biopharma" -l "eastus2" -p "bp" --compliance "21CFR11,GxP"

# Configure connectors for manufacturing systems
./configure-biopharma-connectors.sh -g "rg-sentinel-biopharma" -p "bp" -s "MES,LIMS,INSTRUMENTS"

# Deploy GxP-specific analytics rules
./deploy-compliance-rules.sh -g "rg-sentinel-biopharma" -p "bp" --regulations "21CFR11,GxP"
```

### 4. Configure Specific GxP Monitoring Rules

Implement the following Data Collection Rule (DCR) for GxP system monitoring:

```kql
// GxP System Monitoring DCR Transformation
source
| where SourceSystem has_any ("MES", "SCADA", "QMS", "LIMS")
| extend ValidationStatus = extract("ValidationStatus[:\\s]+([\\w\\-\\.]+)", 1, RawData)
| extend ChangeID = extract("ChangeControlID[:\\s]+([\\w\\-\\.]+)", 1, RawData)
| where ValidationStatus has "Validated"
| where EventType has_any ("Configuration", "Setting", "Parameter", "Recipe")
| project TimeGenerated, SourceSystem, ValidationStatus, UserName, EventType, ChangeID
```

### 5. Validation Testing

Execute formal validation protocol:

1. Create validation plan and test scripts
2. Execute test cases with documented evidence
3. Record deviations and resolve issues
4. Obtain formal approval from quality assurance

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain the following validation documentation:

### Validation Plan
- Scope and approach
- Roles and responsibilities
- Schedule and resources
- Acceptance criteria

### Requirements Specification
- User requirements
- Functional requirements
- Technical requirements
- Interface requirements

### Design Documentation
- System architecture
- Data flow diagrams
- Security controls
- Configuration specifications

### Test Documentation
- Test plan
- Test scripts
- Test execution records
- Traceability matrix

### Validation Report
- Summary of activities
- Deviations and resolutions
- Residual risks
- Approval signatures

## Operational Considerations

Maintain validated state during operations:

### Change Control
- All changes must follow formal change control
- Impact assessment for every change
- Revalidation requirements determination
- Documentation updates

### Periodic Review
- Annual system review
- Effectiveness verification
- Compliance assessment
- Improvement opportunities

### Incident Management
- Documentation of security incidents
- Root cause analysis
- CAPA implementation
- Regulatory reporting assessment
