   * Mass copying of documents from ELN systems
   * After-hours access to proprietary research
   * Suspicious authentication to LIMS

* **Clinical Trial Data Protection**
   * Unauthorized access to subject data
   * Unusual patterns of PHI/PII access
   * Data exfiltration detection for trial databases
   * Protocol deviation indicators

* **Manufacturing System Security**
   * GxP-validated system changes

   * Manufacturing execution system anomalies
   * Supply chain system tampering

* **Research Lab Security**
   * Instrument control system anomalies
   * Research network segmentation violations
   * Laboratory IoT device security
   * Cross-border research data transfers

## Research Data Protection

Special considerations for protecting valuable research intellectual property:

1. **IP Data Identification**
   * Integration with information protection systems
   * Tracking of IP classifications across systems
   * Monitoring of IP data lifecycle events

2. **Research Data Exfiltration Prevention**
   * Example DCR for detecting large research data exports:

```kql
source
| where SourceSystem has_any ("ELN", "LIMS", "ResearchRepo")
| where Operation has_any ("Download", "Export", "Copy", "Print")
| extend DataSize = column_ifexists("DataSize", 0)
| extend DataClassification = column_ifexists("Classification", "")
| where DataSize > 50000000 or DataClassification has_any ("Confidential", "Restricted", "IP")
```

3. **Cross-Border Research Data Monitoring**

```kql
source
| where EventType == "FileAccess" 
| extend UserLocation = column_ifexists("UserLocation", "Unknown")
| extend DataLocation = column_ifexists("DataLocation", "Unknown")
| extend DataClassification = column_ifexists("Classification", "")
| where UserLocation != DataLocation
| where DataClassification has_any ("IP", "Research", "Formula", "Confidential")
```

   * Move bulk research logs to Basic tier
   * Implement aggressive filtering for high-volume research instrumentation

2. **Regional Optimization**
