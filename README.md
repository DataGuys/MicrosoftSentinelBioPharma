## Solution Architecture

### Global Multi-Workspace Design
The solution implements a multi-workspace design with:

1. **Central Sentinel Workspace** for global security operations
2. **Research Workspace** with enhanced intellectual property controls
3. **Clinical Workspace** for patient data protection
4. **Manufacturing Workspace** for GxP environments
5. **Regional Workspaces** aligned with major regulatory domains (US, EU, APAC)

### Bio-Pharma-Specific Data Sources
The solution collects and monitors data from key bio-pharmaceutical systems:

* Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS)
* Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELN)
* Clinical Trial Management Systems (CTMS)
* Pharmacovigilance systems
